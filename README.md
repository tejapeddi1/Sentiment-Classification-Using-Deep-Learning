# Sentiment-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning

This project aims to classify sentiment in text data using neural networks, specifically focusing on the IMDB reviews dataset sourced from Kaggle. Sentiment classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), where the goal is to automatically determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IMDB reviews dataset, available on Kaggle. It consists of a large collection of movie reviews, labeled with sentiment polarity (positive or negative).

For the model training I have used Simple Neural Net, CNN and LSTM; and concluded with reasoning as to why LSTMs are well suited to handle (sequential) text data.
